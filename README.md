<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BSOLwaitinglist is wrap some of the functions in the 2025
planning, and related modelling processes, into a single documented
package that calls others and allows others to produce waiting list
projections and simulations.

Work in progress, not all transfered, tested or built yet.

You can install the development version of BSOLwaitinglist like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Birmingham-and-Solihull-ICS/BSOLwaitinglist", build_vignettes = TRUE)
