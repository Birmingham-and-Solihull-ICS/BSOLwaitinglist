\title{Mean wait required for a desired proportion exceeding target}
\usage{
mean_wait_for_exceeding_target(threshold, p_exceed)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{numeric (>0). The waiting time threshold T (e.g., weeks).}

\item{p_exceed}{numeric in (0,1). Desired proportion exceeding T.}
}
\value{
numeric. The mean wait Wbar.
}
\description{
For exponential waiting times, returns the mean wait Wbar such that
P(W > T) = p_exceed. Uses Wbar = T / ln(1 / p_exceed).
}
\examples{
# P4 example: target T = 52 weeks
mean_wait_for_exceeding_target(52, p_exceed = 0.018)  # ~12.94 weeks (≈ a quarter of target)
mean_wait_for_exceeding_target(52, p_exceed = 0.002)  # ~8.37 weeks (≈ a sixth of target)
mean_wait_for_exceeding_target(52, p_exceed = 0.05)   # ~17.35 weeks

# Vectorised input:
mean_wait_for_exceeding_target(52, p_exceed = c(0.10, 0.05, 0.018))
}
