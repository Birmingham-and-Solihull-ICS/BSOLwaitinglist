\title{Mean wait required for a desired proportion meeting target}
\usage{
mean_wait_for_meeting_target(threshold, p_meeting)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{numeric (>0). The waiting time threshold T (e.g., weeks).}

\item{p_meeting}{numeric in (0,1). Desired proportion meeting T.}
}
\value{
numeric. The mean wait Wbar.
}
\description{
For exponential waiting times, returns the mean wait Wbar such that
P(W > T) = p_exceed. Uses Wbar = T / ln(1 / (1-p_meeting)).
}
\examples{
# P4 example: target T = 52 weeks
mean_wait_for_meeting_target(52, p_exceed = 0.982)  # ~12.94 weeks (≈ a quarter of target)
mean_wait_for_meeting_target(52, p_exceed = 0.998)  # ~8.37 weeks (≈ a sixth of target)
mean_wait_for_meeting_target(52, p_exceed = 0.95)   # ~17.35 weeks

# Vectorised input:
mean_wait_for_meeting_target(52, p_meeting = c(0.982, 0.998, 0.95))
