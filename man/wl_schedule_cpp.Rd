\title{Schedule a waiting list against a sequence of session dates}
\usage{
wl_schedule_cpp(
  waiting_list,
  schedule,
  referral_index = 0L,
  removal_index = 1L,
  unscheduled = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{waiting_list}{A `data.frame` containing the waiting list. It should
include date columns referenced by `referral_index` and (optionally) `removal_index`.}

\item{schedule}{A vector of `Date` values (e.g., `as.Date(...)`) representing
the chronological sequence of session dates used for scheduling.}

\item{referral_index}{Integer (0-based) column index in `waiting_list` that
holds the referral date. Default is `0`.}

\item{removal_index}{Integer (0-based) column index in `waiting_list` that
holds the removal or discharge date (if present). Default is `1`.}

\item{unscheduled}{Logical flag. If `TRUE`, the output will include (or focus on)
cases that could not be scheduled under the provided `schedule`/capacity.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with the scheduling results. The precise schema depends
  on the implementation, but typically includes scheduled dates and indicators
  of whether each record was scheduled or remained unscheduled.
}
\description{
Applies a capacity schedule to a waiting list and returns a data frame
with scheduling results. Column indices are **0-based** (C++ convention).
}
\details{
- Indices are **0-based** in the C++ implementation. When calling from R, pass
  integers consistent with the wrapper defaults (e.g., `0L`, `1L`).
- `schedule` must be of R's `Date` type; ensure inputs are `as.Date(...)`.
- The function assumes `waiting_list` contains the necessary columns referenced
  by the supplied indices.

\dontrun{
wl <- data.frame(
  referral_date = as.Date(c("2024-01-10", "2024-01-15", "2024-01-20")),
  removal_date  = as.Date(c(NA, "2024-02-05", NA))
)
sess <- as.Date(c("2024-02-01", "2024-02-08", "2024-02-15"))

# Column indices are 0-based in C++ (referral=0, removal=1):
res <- wl_schedule_cpp(wl, sess, referral_index = 0L, removal_index = 1L)
head(res)

# Return/Include unscheduled cases:
res_uns <- wl_schedule_cpp(wl, sess, referral_index = 0L, removal_index = 1L,
                           unscheduled = TRUE)
